### Task Management Backend
Welcome to the Task Management Backend.
This project provides a robust API for managing tasks, built with Spring Boot.

# Getting Started

This section will help you understand the project structure and how to interact with the API.


### Key Controllers
* TaskManagementController: Handles all operations related to tasks (e.g., creating, reading, updating, deleting tasks).


* AuthController: Manages user authentication and authorization flows.

### Guides & Resources
Explore the following resources to get a deeper understanding of the project's features and setup:

* API Calls (HTTP Requests): You'll find a collection of ready-to-use API calls for testing and interacting with the Task Management endpoints. These are located in the resources/httprequests folder and serve the same purpose as a Postman collection.


* Database Migrations: All database schema creation and data insertion scripts are managed using Liquibase. You can find these migration scripts in the resources/db/changelog folder.

* API Documentation: Detailed API documentation, generated using OpenAPI (Swagger), can be found in the swagger.json file. This file describes all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.


### Technologies Used
This project leverages the following key tools and technologies:

* Maven: For dependency management and project build automation.
* PostgreSQL: The relational database used for storing task data.
* Liquibase: For managing database schema changes and version control.
